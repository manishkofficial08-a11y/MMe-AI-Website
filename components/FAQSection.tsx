      q: "What exactly is MMe-AI?",
      a: "It's an AI-powered business operating layer that connects leads, customers, workflows, automation and analytics into one system built around your business.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is MMe-AI a CRM?",
      a: "No. A CRM stores records. MMe-AI connects your workflows, automates repetitive work and surfaces what needs attention across your team.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do we need to replace our existing software?",
      a: "No. MMe-AI is designed to work alongside the tools you already use, including your current CRM, email, WhatsApp, and spreadsheets.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is MMe-AI different from a normal dashboard?",
      a: "A dashboard only shows data. MMe-AI acts on it — automating steps, triggering reminders, qualifying leads, and highlighting what needs immediate action.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can MMe-AI be customized for our industry?",
      a: "Yes. Workflows, dashboards and automations are configured around your specific industry and process — from real estate to healthcare, education, retail, and local services.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you integrate with our existing tools?",
      a: "MMe-AI connects with your existing tools where supported, bridging the gap between your communication channels and operational databases.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can we start with one workflow?",
      a: "Yes. Most teams start with a single high-effort workflow, prove the measurable time savings and conversion boost, and expand from there.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does a pilot usually include?",
      a: "We pick one high-impact workflow, map the current process, automate it, and refine it with your team during a 30-day optimization sprint.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is pricing calculated?",
      a: "MMe-AI runs on three transparent B2B tiers—Basic (₹30,000/mo), Pro (₹65,000/mo), and Plus/Enterprise (₹1,20,000+/mo). Each tier includes predictable monthly AI credits covering reasoning and multi-step executions, built-in daily rate safeguards for 100% uptime, and custom enterprise pricing available on request.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who is MMe-AI designed for?",
      a: "Founders, sales leaders, operations heads, and growing businesses that want more visibility, faster response times, and less manual busywork.",
    },
